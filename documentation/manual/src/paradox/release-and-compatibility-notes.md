# Release and Compatibility Notes

## Binary Compatibility and Versioning

We follow the [recommended versioning scheme](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/binary-compatibility-for-library-authors.html#recommended-versioning-scheme)
for Scala projects:

- all the releases with the same *major* version number are backward
  binary compatible,
- all the releases with the same *major* and *minor* version numbers are
  backward source compatible.
