# Design in a nutshell

You have seen in the @ref[quick start](quick-start.md) page that using the _endpoints_ library consists in
first defining abstract **descriptions** of HTTP endpoints, and then producing clients, servers, or
documentation, by **interpreting** these descriptions. This page takes a step back to
explain the underlying architecture of the library, and then provides some guidelines
to embrace this design.

## Descriptions and Interpretations

Here is an example of endpoint description:

@@snip [CounterEndpoints.scala](/documentation/examples/quickstart/endpoints/src/main/scala/quickstart/CounterEndpoints.scala) { #get-endpoint-definition }

Endpoint descriptions are defined in terms of operations (e.g., `endpoint`, `get`, `path`, `ok`, etc.)
provided by traits living in the @scaladoc[`endpoints4s.algebra` package](endpoints4s.algebra.index).
These operations are all **abstract**. Furthermore, their return **types** are also abstract. Their
purpose is only to define the **rules** for constructing and combining parts of HTTP endpoint
descriptions. This is why they are called “algebra interfaces”, or just **algebras**.

For instance, consider the following truncated version of the
@scaladoc[`Endpoints` algebra](endpoints4s.algebra.Endpoints):

~~~ scala
package endpoints4s.algebra

trait Endpoints {
  /** A request that uses the method GET and the given URL */
  def get[A](url: Url[A]): Request[A]

  /** A request that carries an `A` information */
  type Request[A]
  /** An URL that carries an `A` information */
  type Url[A]
}
~~~

Here, the `get` method provides a way to define an HTTP request description from a URL description.

@@@note
Since the `Request[A]` type is abstract, the _only_ way to construct a value of that type is
by calling a method that returns a `Request[A]`, such as the method `get`, in the above
code. For this reason, we say that the method `get` is a **constructor** for `Request[A]`.
@@@

The `Request[A]` type models an HTTP request that *carries* an information of type `A`. From a client
point of view, this `A` is what is **needed** to build a `Request[A]`. Conversely, from a server point
of view, this `A` is what is **provided** by an incoming a `Request[A]`.

You have seen in the “quick start” page that **interpreters** give semantics to the algebras. They
do so by fixing their type members and implementing their methods accordingly. For instance, here is the
semantics given to `Request[A]` by the Scala.js client interpreter:

~~~ scala
package endpoints4s.xhr

trait Endpoints extends endpoints4s.algebra.Endpoints {
  type Request[A] = js.Function1[A, XMLHttpRequest]
}
~~~

As previously said, from a client point of view we want to send requests and get responses. So, `Request[A]`
has the semantics of a function that builds an `XMLHttpRequest` out of an `A` value.

Here is the semantics given by the Play-based server interpreter:

~~~ scala
package endpoints4s.play.server

trait Endpoints extends endpoints4s.algebra.Endpoints {
  type Request[A] = RequestHeader => Option[BodyParser[A]]
}
~~~

The aim of the `endpoints4s.play.server.Endpoints` trait is to provide a Play router for a given set of HTTP endpoints. So,
a `Request[A]` is a function that checks if an incoming request matches this endpoint, and in such
a case it returns a `BodyParser[A]` that decodes a value of type `A` from the request.

As you can see, each interpreter brings its own **concrete semantic type** for `Request[A]`. Client
interpreters typically fix the `Request[A]` type to a function that *takes* an `A` as parameter. Conversely,
server interpreters typically fix the `Request[A]` type to a function that *returns* an `A`. Can you guess
what documentation interpreters do with this type parameter `A`? You can see the answer
@scaladoc[here](endpoints4s.openapi.Requests#Request[A]=Requests.this.DocumentedRequest). It is
discarded because this type `A` models the information that is carried by an actual request, at run-time,
but the documentation is static (so, there is no `A` value to deal with).

@@@note
This technique has been described in details by Bruno C. d. S. Oliveira *et al.* [1].
Note that we use a variant discovered by Christian Hofer *et al.* [2], which uses
type members rather than type parameters.

### Summary

**Algebras** are traits that provide abstract type members and methods defining how to
**construct** and **combine** endpoint descriptions.

**Interpreters** are traits that extend algebras, and give them a concrete meaning by
fixing their type members and implementing their methods accordingly.

## Modular Algebras

The separation between descriptions and interpretations provides one dimension of
modularity: a same endpoint description can be interpreted with a client interpreter,
a server interpreter, or documentation interpreter. Even more, the client and server
stacks can be completely different (one can use Play framework while the other uses
Akka, for instance). Here is a diagram illustrating the fact that multiple
interpreters can be applied to a same algebra:

![multiple-interpreters](multiple-interpreters.svg)

@@@note
From that perspective, endpoint descriptions are equivalent to protobuf or Swagger
files: they are machine-readable descriptors for a service. As a consequence, if you
want to share a descriptor of your service with the outside world, one option is
to publish the artifact containing the traits that provide your endpoint descriptions.
Downstream users will then be able to turn these descriptions to a client of
their choice by applying the interpreter of their choice. Of course, this works only
if your users use Scala. For the rest of the world, you can distribute the
descriptor produced by the OpenAPI interpreter.
@@@

The fact that algebras are defined in traits and that we can mix several traits
together provides a second dimension of modularity: the algebra itself is modular.
For instance, you have seen in the code example at the top of this page that two
algebras were used together: `algebra.Endpoints` and `algebra.JsonEntitiesFromSchemas`.
The diagram below shows a couple of algebras and their relations:

![extensible-algebra](extensible-algebra.svg)

We say that the `BasicAuthentication` algebra **enriches** the `Endpoints` algebra
with operations related to authentication.

The fact that algebras are modular is a double-edged sword. On one hand, having several
algebra modules makes it possible for some interpreters to support only a subset of them.
Consider for instance an algebra for describing Web Sockets. Not all HTTP clients or servers
have a good support of Web Sockets, which means that not all HTTP clients or servers could
interpret such an algebra. However, this is not a problem: that algebra module can
be skipped, and the interpreters can focus on supporting only the modules that are
relevant to them. Another benefit is that the algebras provided by the _endpoints_ library
can be extended *outside* of the library itself. Any application-specific concern can
be introduced as another algebra without having to make the _endpoints_ library aware of
it. This point is illustrated in the
@ref[authentication example](guides/custom-authentication.md).

On the other hand, a modular algebra means that you have to select the algebra modules
to use before you can write endpoint descriptions. For instance, the provided
`Endpoints` algebra is minimalist and is unlikely to be enough for your needs. Most
probably, you will complete it with one of the `JsonEntities` algebras. Once you have
settled on the algebra modules you want to use, you will have to find the matching
interpreter modules. In general, interpreters follow a specific
@ref[naming convention](algebras-and-interpreters.md#naming-conventions) that should make
this process easier.

Another consequence of the modularity of the algebras is that the library *intentionally*
provides a minimal set of features. The aim is to cover most users’ needs in the main
algebra, and let the community experiment with other algebra modules on their own before
considering including them into the main algebra.

### Summary

Algebras are **modular**. You select the algebras that provide the features
you need, and you can even create your own algebras for more specific needs.
The more algebras are used, the less interpreters can interpret them.
