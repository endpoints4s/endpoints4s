# Algebras and interpreters

In *endpoints*, we call “algebra interfaces” (or just **algebras**) the
traits that provide methods for constructing and combining descriptions
of endpoints. You can find more details about the design of these
algebras in the [Design in a nutshell](design.md) page.

The concepts defined by algebras are given a concrete meaning by **interpreters**.
In practice, we have three kinds of interpreters:

- clients building requests (their URL, headers and entity) and decoding responses,
- servers decoding requests and building responses,
- documentation in a machine-readable format.

## Naming conventions

- algebras are defined as traits in the `endpoints.algebra` package ;
    - e.g. the [`endpoints.algebra.Urls`](unchecked:/api/endpoints/algebra/Urls.html) trait defines
      an algebra for describing URLs.
- algebras’ dependencies can be found in their super types ;
- interpreters are traits that have the same name of the corresponding
  algebra (they can also be found by looking at the “known
  subclasses” of an algebra, in the Scaladoc) ;
    - e.g. the [`endpoints.play.client.Urls`](unchecked:/api/endpoints/play/client/Urls.html) trait
      defines a Play-based interpreter for the `Urls` algebra.
- compatible interpreters are in the same package ;
  - e.g. the [`endpoints.play.client`](unchecked:/api/endpoints/play/client/index.html)
    package provides interpreters that are all based on
    [Play WS](https://github.com/playframework/play-ws) under the hood.

## Algebras

Algebras form a **hierarchy**: it is possible to extend an algebra
with additional vocabulary, or to mix several algebras together
to merge their vocabulary. This hierarchy can be seen in the
[diagram](unchecked:/api/endpoints/algebra/index.html#content-diagram-container)
generated by the API documentation.

The following table lists the available algebras and points to their documentation.
You should start by reading the documentation of the `Endpoints` algebra, and the
documentation of the `JsonEntities` and `JsonSchemas` algebras if you want to
work with JSON.

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
|[Endpoints](algebras/endpoints.md)|HTTP endpoints|
|[JsonEntities](algebras/json-entities.md)|JSON request and response entities|
|[JsonSchemas](algebras/json-schemas.md)|JSON schemas of data types|
|[ChunkedEntities](algebras/chunked-entities.md)|Streamed requests and responses|
|[Assets](algebras/assets.md)|Asset segments, endpoints serving fingerprinted assets|
|[MuxEndpoints](algebras/mux-endpoints.md)|Multiplexed HTTP endpoints|

## Interpreters

Interpreters give a concrete meaning to the vocabulary and operations provided
by the algebras. They usually rely on other libraries (e.g. circe, Akka HTTP, etc.)
to do so. Pick the interpreters that fit your existing stack!

| Family | Description |
|---|---|
|[Akka HTTP](interpreters/akka-http.md)|Client and server backed by [Akka HTTP](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/)|
|[Play framework](interpreters/play.md)|Client and server backed by [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com/)|
|[Scala.js web](interpreters/scalajs-web.md)|Scala.js web clients using `XMLHttpRequest`|
|[scalaj-http](interpreters/scalaj-http.md)|JVM client backed by [scalaj-http](https://github.com/scalaj/scalaj-http)|
|[sttp](interpreters/sttp.md)|JVM client backed by [sttp](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp)|
|[OpenAPI](interpreters/openapi.md)|Generates [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) documents for endpoints definitions|
|[circe](interpreters/circe.md)|Builds [circe](http://circe.github.io/circe/) codecs out of JSON schema definitions|
|[Play JSON](interpreters/play-json.md)|Builds [Play JSON](https://github.com/playframework/play-json) Reads and Writes out of JSON schema definitions|

> {.note}
> Note that you can mix stacks. For instance, you can have a server backed by
> Play framework using Play JSON, a client backed by Akka HTTP using Circe,
> and another client backed by Scala.js (for web browsers) using Circe.
